# Data-Cleaning : Handling Missing Values and Outlier Analyses 
We are given with two csv files , “landslide_data3_miss.csv” is a file that contains 
some missing values and “landslide_data3_original.csv” is the original file without 
any missing values. This dataset contains the readings from various sensors installed at 10 locations 
around Mandi district. These sensors give the details about the factors like temperature, humidity, 
pressure etc. We have to analyse and fill the missing values and outliers with the appropriate methods.
